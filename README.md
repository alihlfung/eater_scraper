# eater_scraper
Description: Scrapes info from Eater's restaurant lists which then populates a Google spreadsheet. Done out of laziness for researching food places in a new city.

Follow the instructions here to set up your own Google Sheets API: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/read-write-google-sheets-python/. You'll create a private key in JSON format which you will need to save to your own local environment. I named my JSON file "eater-scraper-key.json".
